# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

<h3>Test 실행 명령어</h3>
npx hardhat test ./test/test.js <br>

<h3>Test install </h3>
npm install --save-dev hardhat <br>
npm install --save-dev chai <br>
npm install ethers <br>
